# @qbit/approval-service

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- 6f06a0b: Bind each approval to an id, so that a window settles only the approval it rendered (#311). `ApprovalService.requestApproval` now gives every approval a random 128-bit id, and `getApproval()` returns `{ id, data }` instead of the bare data (`undefined` when none is pending). `resolveApproval(id, data?, forceReject?)` and `rejectApproval(id, err?, stay?, isInternal?)` take that id first. They settle the approval only while it is still the pending one, checking and settling in one step, and return `true`; for any other id they settle nothing, close no window, emit no event and return `false`. Previously a window that rendered approval A resolved or rejected approval B when B replaced A between the window's read and its answer, for example after a lock or unlock, a window close or a dapp retry. `openNotification(winProps?, approvalId?)` opens the window for `approvalId`, by default the pending approval. `handleWindowRemoved` now rejects only the approval its window was opened for and returns whether it did, and a window that finishes opening after its approval settled is closed instead of becoming the approval window. An approval whose window fails to open is now rejected with `ErrorCodes.UNKNOWN` (`Approval window failed to open`), and one whose window is closed before it finishes opening with `UserCancel`, instead of staying pending and refusing every later request as already pending. `Approval['data']` is now `ApprovalData`: either a provider request (`ProviderApprovalData`, whose `state` and `approvalType` are optional because the provider omits them) or the provider's unlock request (`UnlockApprovalData`, `{ lock: true }`). These types and `PendingApproval` are exported from the package root.

  The wallet controller's `getApproval`, `resolveApproval` and `rejectApproval` change the same way, and `resolveUnlockApproval` still resolves only the unlock request, in one step. In `wallet-state`, `WalletController` and `ApprovalContextType` take the approval id as the first argument of `resolveApproval` and `rejectApproval`, which now resolve to whether they settled it, and `getApproval` returns the new `PendingApproval`. `ApprovalContextType` accepts `undefined` from a screen that rendered no approval, which settles nothing. `SignPsbtProps` and `SignMessageProps` take an optional `approvalId`, the approval their default handlers settle.

  Breaking change: callers must pass the id from `getApproval` to settle an approval. A call with any other value, including the old `(data, forceReject)` and `(reason, stay)` arguments, is ignored.
